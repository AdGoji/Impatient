# Cascading for the Impatient

The Impatient series is a set of tutorials to get you started with
http://cascading.org/[Cascading 2.2].

This set of progressive coding examples starts with a simple file copy and
builds up to a MapReduce implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm.

Prerequisites
-------------

The code of this tutorial is hosted on
https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient[github]. Please clone it onto your local
disk like so:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient

Each part has its own sub-directory in the repository.

In order to follow the tutorial, you will also have to have
http://gradle.org[gradle] and http://hadoop.apache.org/[apache hadoop] installed
on your computer. You do not need a hadoop cluster,local mode is sufficient.

Gradle
~~~~~~

Everything has been tested with gradle 1.6. You can check your version of gradle
like this:

    $ gradle -v
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Gradle 1.6
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    ...

Hadoop
~~~~~~

For hadoop please install the latest stable version from the 1.x series. At the
time of this writing, this means apache hadoop 1.2.1.

    $ hadoop version
    Hadoop 1.2.1
    ...

Cascading is compatible with a number of hadoop distributions and versions. You
can see on the http://www.cascading.org/support/compatibility/[compatibility
page], if your distribution is supported.


IDE support
~~~~~~~~~~~

While an IDE is not strictly required to follow the tutorials, it is certainly
useful. You can easily create an http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA]
compatible project in each part of the tutorial like this:

    $ gradle ideaModule

If you prefer http://eclipse.org[eclipse], you can run:

   gradle eclipse


link:impatient1.html[Part 1]
----------------------------
